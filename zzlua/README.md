Here are the results of my quick foray into Lua and NodeMCU.

When I tried to load the bmp180 demo and ran out of memory I
declared NodeMCU a disaster and train wreck and never looked
back.  Apparently the project has used up almost all of
memory on the ESP8266 leaving nothing for the end user.

I didn't want to learn yet another language anyway ...
