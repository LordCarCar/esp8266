Here are a variety of ESP8266 related things.
I like to work with C and the sdk, so you will find quite a lot of
that here.  Also I have put some energy into disassembling and
annotating the ESP8266 bootrom.

People have found my tcp_server code useful:

    mysdk/misc/tcp_server.c

The Bootrom disassembly is here:

    reverse/bootrom/boot.txt
