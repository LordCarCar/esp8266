Various miner scripts extract information
from 3 files that seem useful into *.sy files.

Then I merge symbols by hand.
Note that these files are sorted into address order.

I put all the ram symbols into dataram.sy
I put all the rom symbols into rom.sy

The bottom line is that ALL the symbols are in eagle.
The Kongo files (python or disassembly) do not add anything new.
Odds are that the 1.5.0 SDK "made public" some symbols that
were not in the exported symbol list in prior releases.

I hand added the symbol _rom_start
