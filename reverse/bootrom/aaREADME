My notes on maintaining this project.

1) boot.txt is the crucial file that I edit and annotate.

2) make cinstall publishes this to my website on cholla.

3) I also have this on github, to publish it there:
    git add .
    git commit
    git push github master

4) Sometimes I find patches of the disassembly that need rework.
    Let's say I decide I have a block at 40005d03
    I do this:
	./short_dump 5d03 >zzz
    Then I edit it in by hand

5) Other times I find a patch of memory that should be displayed
    as a 32 bit value to be referenced by a l32r
    then I user:
	./dumper 5c44 
    And again, I edit it in by hand
    The source for dumper is in reverse/tools
