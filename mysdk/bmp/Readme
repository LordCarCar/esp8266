I found some nice work by Matt Callow, and he has put it all up
on Github.  So I downloaded the zip file and found that his
05i2cdemo looked like a nice tidy big of code without extra nonsense.

ttps://github.com/mattcallow/esp8266-sdk/tree/master/apps

I pulled just the i2c code for the BH1750 gadget and put it all
under my Makefile (which keeps everything in just one directory)
and got it to compile quite easily.  I am ignoring his uart
routines for now.
