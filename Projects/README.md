This is where the action is at as far as my ESP8266 stuff.
Many of these things are just proof of concept experiments,
but some are actually useful.

These are not well named, but this list may help.

1. misc - a directory full of my early experiments
2. blink2 - blink a single LED using the OS timer
3. blink3 - blink an LED and make fast pulses using the HW timer
4. sleep - (demo) deep sleep experiment (simple and useless)
5. pulses - generate pulses to test my oscilloscope
6. bmp - a collection of i2c drivers, including bmp180

7. easy - first cut at a DHT-22 and RHT03 driver
8. dht_tt - a DHT-22 driver with a lot of cleanup
9. espdht - first cut at a DHT-22 driver with Wifi access

10. tmon - my outdoor temperature monitor with an RHT03 (DH22 clone)
11. coolstat - my coolstat motor status hack
12. led_server - TCP server to control LEDs.
13. bell - TCP server to ring my workshop bell.
